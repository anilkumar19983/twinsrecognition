                          Distinguishing Identical Twins by Face Recognition
Introduction
	Authentic and precise verification of people is exceedingly important in a Number of business transaction as well as access to favor information. Biometrics, which refers to automatic identification of people based on their physical or behavioral characteristics, is constitutionally more reliable than traditional knowledge-based (password) or token-based (access card) methods of identification. Identical twins can have biometric signatures that are very similar, especially when the signature is derived from a face image. While face recognition software system exhibited inadequate performance, there is other biometric modalities that can offer a performance increase at the cost of increased invasiveness. In this the focus is to review the performance of current face recognition algorithm on a dataset containing face image of identical twins. As the performance of face recognition system in constrained environment continues to improve focus is shifting from methods that improve face recognition performance in general, to methods that handle specific cases of failure. Until recently, a scenario that has been known to confound even human face recognition had not been studied for automated face recognition systems. This setup is the ability to distinguish between identical twins. Because identical twins are genetically equivalent, their facial appearance is also quite similar. Generally, differences in their appearance can only be attributed to exposure to different environmental factors and rare cases of genetic mutations. The work flow of the system is shown below. The proposed system is based on four primary stages. The different phases are Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Classification, and Verification. 




Preprocessing:
The aim of preprocessing is improvement of the image data that suppresses unwanted distortions or enhances some images features important for further processing. 

Feature Extraction:
Feature extraction is a special form of dimensional reduction. Transforming the input data into the set of features is nothing but the feature extraction. Two kinds of features are used in pattern recognition problems. One is face alignment and second one is face landmark. The similar facial components are placed into one groups while the others in different group. To encode this similarity, there is descriptor, which is useful for classification of similar facial feature. 

Classification
After extracting the facial features their length, width and area are computed 
by some classifier. Classification is based on different conditions. This classifier helps to construct discriminating groups to recognize probe face sketch 
through face photos database.

Verification
The features of face are grouped in one category and are compared with already extracted feature of face and if matching is found indicates twins otherwise not.


Conclusion 
We conclude that it is possible to distinguish identical twins under ideal and also give more accuracy in less ideal condition also using subject which is side view. 


                                Introduction to Facial Recognition


Facial Recognition:
             In facial recognition there are two types of comparisons.
VERIFICATION:
                      The system compares the given individual with who they say they are and gives a yes or no decision.
IDENTIFICATION:
                      The system compares the given individual to all the other individuals in the database and gives the list of matches.
All identification or authentication technologies operate using the following four features 
Capture
            A Physical or behavioral sample is captured by the system during the Enrollment and also in identification or verification process.
Extraction:
             Unique data is extracted from the sample and a template is created.
Comparison:
            The template is then compared with the new sample.
Match/Non-match:
             The system decides if the features extracted from the new samples are match or a non-match.
Image acquisition:
      	 Facial-scan technology can acquire faces from almost any static camera or video system that generates images of sufficient quality and resolution.
High quality enrollment is essential to eventual verification and identification enrollment images define the facial characteristics to be used in all future authentication events.


Image processing:
             Images are cropped such that the ovoid facial image remains, and color images are normally converted to black and white in order to facilitate initial comparisons based on grayscale characteristics.
   First the presence of faces or face in a scene must be detected. Once the face is detected, it must be localized and Normalization process may be required to bring the dimensions of the live facial sample in alignment with the one on the template. 
Distinctive Characteristic Location:
       All facial systems attempt to match visible facial features in a fashion similar to the way people recognize one another.
     The features most often utilized in facial-scan systems are those least likely to change significantly over time: upper ridges of the eye sockets, areas around the cheekbones, sides of the mouth, nose shape and the position of major features relative to each other.
How facial recognition system works
      Facial recognition software is based on the ability to first recognize faces, which is a technology feat in itself, if you look at the mirror, you can see that your face has certain distinguishable landmarks. These are the peaks and valleys that make up the different facial features. 
Strengths:
    It has the ability to use maximum advantage on image acquisition.
   It can search against static images such as driverâ€™s license photographs.
   It is only biometric able to operate without user cooperation.
Weakness:
    Changes in acquisition environment reduce matching accuracy.
    Changes in physiological characteristics reduce matching accuracy.
